Hi everyone, Matt Groves here

Today I'm going to show you how to install couchbase on Windows Azure
using the Azure Marketplace

portal.azure.com

click + New

search "Couchbase" hit enter

click 4.0.0 community edition, click "create"

Name: MyCouchbaseVM
User name: mgroves
Password: G2G#QBY1$Oge
Resource Group: MyCouchbaseResourceGroup

A3 Standard, A3 Basic is another possibility if you are budget minded

Settings:

	Before I proceed, note that I am not a devops or security expert
	I'm just trying to get you up and running on Azure with Couchbase
	When you decide to go into production, please carefully consider the settings
	And consult with devops and/or security professionals

	New virtual network, defaults are fine
	Subnet: change the name to MyCouchbaseSubnet
	Network security group:
		Add inbound rule
			Name: AllowCouchbaseInbound
			Priority: 100
			Source: Any
			Protocol: TCP
			Destination Port Range: *
		
		Add outbound rule
			Name: AllowCouchbaseOutbound
			Destination Port range: *
			Protocol: TCP
			Source port range: *
	
	Disable monitoring

Buy:
	Couchbase Server Community is no charge
	Microsoft is charging for the VM
	If I were to use Couchbase Enterprise, there would be a cost
	I want to point out that Azure credits cannot be used on the Couchbase purchase, only on the Microsoft purchase
		I believe this is a constraint that Microsoft imposes

	Now click purchase

Deployment has started

This will take around 3-5 minutes, so I'm going to hit fast-forward and come back when the deployment is finished

[Time lapse started around 11:10am, ended around 11:13am]

Deployment is completed, and the machine is running

Now that the machine is deployed, I can get an IP address

Open this IP address in another browser window on port 8091, which is the standard couchbase console port

Start new cluster, use defaults

Now your couchbase cluster with a single node is set up. You can start adding more nodes
or you can start writing code that uses this cluster

Thanks for watching
