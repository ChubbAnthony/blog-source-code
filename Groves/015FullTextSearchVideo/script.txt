We're looking at Couchbase Server 4.5
and a new feature that is in developer preview
called Full Text Search

Full text search gives us a 'search engine'
for documents in a Couchbase bucket

It's language aware and ranks results with a relevance score

----

Looking at the Couchbase Console, go to nodes, I just
have a single node cluster set up here, and it indeed has
the Full Text service enabled

I'll go over to Data Buckets, and you can see that I have
the travel-sample bucket loaded, with 31000+ documents in it

----

In the sample data, there are documents of type 'landmark'

I can query a few of them with N1QL like so:

select * from `travel-sample` where type='landmark' LIMIT 10;

I can see that landmarks have a 'content' field and that would be
nice to be able to search for with language awareness and relevance
say I wanted to find a 'bed and breakfast'

----

Let's go to the Index tab, and then click Full Text

I'll add a new index, I'll call it "LandmarkContentIndex"
choose the bucket
then I'll expand 'type mappings'

I want this search to just be for landmarks, so I'll click 'add type mapping'
and enter 'landmark' as the type name
this would make any 'landmark' document available for full text search

now I want to restrict it further to just look in the content field
so I'll check 'only index specified fields' and hit 'ok'
now I have to specify the fields, so I'll click the 'plus' and say 'insert child field'
I enter the field name, which was 'content'
leave everything else as-is, except I'm also going to check 'store', you'll see why in a bit
and then hit 'ok'

finally, there's this 'default' type mapping. this is here to make every field in the bucket
searchable by default, which might be nice for a demo, but we're moving beyond that
so I'll edit it and uncheck 'enabled'

then I'll click 'create index'

I can now watch the index being created, and click 'refesh' to see how far it's gotten
since we're just indexing 1 field on 1 type of document, it shouldn't take long

----

Now let's put the index to use. To demonstrate, I don't even have to leave the console,
I'll just click 'Full Text' again, and select the new index in the dropdown
and enter a search, like "bed and breakfast"

Couchbase Console will give me a paged list of documents, I can click the link to see the whole document

also notice that I'm seeing a highlighted fragment of the content field based on my search terms
remember when I checked that 'store' icon? if I didn't do that, then I would only see the document IDs, not the fragments

----

Any of the couchbase SDKs that support this (I know that at least .NET does) support
full text search: you just supply the name of the index, the search query, and you'll get back results and highlighted fragments

----

Remember that this feature is currently a developer preview and is not yet officially supported
by couchbase. In fact, if you want to contribute to the RFC, you can have a say in how this feature is ultimately
implemented. I've put a link in the video description.

Thanks for watching!
