= Upcoming #Couchbase Events in Austin, Houston and New York City

I'm going to be in Texas from October 10th to October 13th. If you're in either of those areas and interested in NoSQL and link:http://developer.couchbase.com/?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[Couchbase], now is a good chance to attend some sessions, visit some great user groups, and ask me questions in-person.
