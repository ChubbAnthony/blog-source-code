= Copying Documents Between Buckets in Couchbase

When I'm at a user group or conference, people often come up to me afterwards with good questions. This is a great way for me to get blog post ideas: if they have a question, chances are lots of other people have the same one. It's also a great way for me to get to know link:http://developer.couchbase.com/?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[Couchbase] better.

This post is for one of those questions: **can I copy documents from one bucket to another**?

== Copy from bucket to bucket

Yes! In fact, if you've done this sort of thing in SQL, then you are not too far from already knowing the answer.

There are command line tools to link:http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/cli/cbbackup-tool.html?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[backup]/link:http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.5/cli/cbrestore-tool.html?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[restore] a bucket, but for this post, I'm going to assume that what you want is to make a copy of some documents from bucket A into bucket B.

It's as easy as using a link:http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.5/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/insert.html?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[N1QL INSERT].

Start by creating a N1QL ```SELECT``` to get the documents you want out of the first bucket. I'm going to show a very simplified ```SELECT``` that gets _all_ the documents from my ```default``` bucket. If you only want a subset, you can use a ```WHERE``` clause.

[source, SQL]
----
SELECT META().id _k, _v
from `default` _v
----

Since we're copying to another bucket, we need both the key and the document itself. This query selects the document key using the ```META()``` function, and selects the document using a ```_v``` alias.

Next, I'll create an ```INSERT``` to put these selected documents into another bucket, which I called ```target```.

[source, SQL]
----
INSERT INTO `target` (KEY _k, VALUE _v)
SELECT META().id _k, _v
from `default` _v
----

An ```INSERT``` needs a key and a value. I have those from the ```SELECT```. All done.

== More information about N1QL INSERT

The link:link:http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.5/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/insert.html?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[N1QL INSERT] is very powerful, and there are a lot of other things you can do with it:

* Insert a single document
* Bulk inserts
* Insert values using ```SELECT``` (which is similar to what we did in this post)
* Insert value with a combination key, using a projection
* Insert values using subqueries
* Insert values using N1QL functions
* Using prepared ```INSERT``` queries

Note that typical caveats apply: make sure you have good indexing when you are writing the SELECT. If you are copying a lot of documents, you may want to temporarily adjust the timeout. Documents in a bucket must all have a unique key. There is no rollback when inserting multiple documents: if an ```INSERT``` fails on the 10th document out of 100, the first 9 documents are still inserted.
