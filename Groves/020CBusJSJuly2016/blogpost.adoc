= Node.js and Couchbase - July 2016, Columbus Ohio (video)

I was a guest speaker at the link:https://cbusjs.github.io/[CBusJS Columbus JavaScript User Group] on July 20, 2016. My topic was link:https://cbusjs.github.io/07-20-2016/full-stack-development-with-nodejs-and-nosql.html[Full Stack Development with Node.js and NoSQL]. The group and venue was kind enough to let me record the session. I've posted it on YouTube.

Thanks to everyone that came out, and if you're ever in the Columbus area and interested in JavaScript, I highly recommend this group.
