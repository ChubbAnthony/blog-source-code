= .NET and Couchbase - August 2016, Dayton Ohio (video)

I was a guest speaker at the link:http://daytondevgroup.net/[Dayton .NET Developers Group] on August 24, 2016. My topic was link:http://daytondevgroup.net/?p=347[Full Stack Development with .NET and NoSQL]. The group and venue kindly allowed me to record the session, and so I've posted it on YouTube.

Thanks to everyone that came out. Dayton has some really interesting things going on in the technical field, and they have a very nice baseball park for the Single-A Dayton Dragons (which I checked out while I was in town, of course!)
