= Upcoming #Couchbase Events in Chicago

I'm going to be in Chicago for most of next week. If you're in Chicago and interested in NoSQL and Couchbase, now is a good chance to attend some sessions, visit some great user groups, and ask me questions in-person.

I won't be at Wrigley Field (the above image was doctored :), but here's where I _will_ be:

Three different sessions and three great Chicago groups. There will be some surprises in store, and I'm going to bring whatever stickers and swag that I can fit in my luggage with me.
